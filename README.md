Your Next.js app with seamless Steam authentication! üéâ

This is a streamlined and improved version of the Steam authentication provider for [next-auth](https://npm.im/next-auth)! üéÆ This package is a fork of [Nekonyx/next-auth-steam](https://github.com/Nekonyx/next-auth-steam), designed to optimize your authentication flow and eliminate unnecessary overhead. Say goodbye to the mandatory `request` parameter everywhere and the frequent need for `getServersideProps`‚Äîthis implementation is all about efficiency and developer happiness! üòÑ

## üåü What's New?

- ‚ú® Request parameter is optional in majority of the cases, although this is required when utilized with `NextAuth`. Therefore for `NextAuth()` you should pass it by default. However on `useSession` or `getServerSession` is optional.
- üõ†Ô∏è Simplified implementation for `getServerSession`.
- üî• Examples and usage patterns to get you started in no time!
- `onUserInfoRequest` a simple method that you can have access to the context, plus keeping your api key secure, why? We value your security. These keys shouldn't be just passed when is not needed.

## üì¶ Install

```bash
npm install @novaplay/next-auth-steam
```

```bash
yarn add @novaplay/next-auth-steam
```

```bash
pnpm install @novaplay/next-auth-steam
```

## üîç Example Usage

### üîπ Basic Authentication Setup

This setup can be utlized for both app router and legacy version router.

```ts
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import { onUserInfoRequestContext } from '@novaplay/next-auth-steam'

const auth = async (req: any, res: any) => {
  return await NextAuth(req, res, {
    providers: [
      SteamProvider(
        {
          nextAuthUrl: `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL!}/api/auth/callback`, // https://example.com/api/auth/callback/steam
          onUserInfoRequest: (ctx: onUserInfoRequestContext) => {
            // execute something on token request
            // some profile data which will be returned back to you on the client
            // example get the player data and merge it with the user info, therefore you wont need to pass any secret to us

            const response = await fetch(
              `https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=${MY_API_KEY}&steamids=${ctx.tokens.steamId}`
            )

            const data = await response.json()
            return data.response.players[0]
          }
        },
        req
      )
    ]
  })
}

export { auth as GET, auth as POST }
```

### üîπ Advanced Authentication | Real Example

This example covers a real world scenario authentication with fetching of steam user data. In simple terms we've got `onUserInfoRequest` which where you will get your steam player summary data with your own API KEY.

```tsx
// utils/auth.ts
import { AuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import { STEAM_PROVIDER_ID, onUserInfoRequestContext } from '@novaplay/next-auth-steam'

export const authOptions: AuthOptions = {
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
  },
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
  providers: [
    ...
    SteamProvider({
      nextAuthUrl: `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL!}/api/auth/callback`,
    }),
  ]
  callbacks: {
    async signIn({ user, account, profile, email, credentials }) {

      // Handle after sign in
      return true
    },
    async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
      // Handle your redirection if any
      return baseUrl
    },
    async session({ session, user, token }) {
      // Handle your session
      if ('steam' in token) {
        session.user.steam = token.steam
      }

      return session
    },
    async jwt({ token, user, account, profile, isNewUser }) {
      // Handle your jwt
      if (account?.provider === STEAM_PROVIDER_ID) {
        token.steam = profile
      }

      return token
    }
  }
}

export const authOptionsWithRequest: (request: NextApiRequest | NextRequest) = (request: NextApiRequest | NextRequest) => {
  return {
    ...authOptions,
    providers: [
      ...authOptions.providers.filter(({ id }) =>  id !== STEAM_PROVIDER_ID),
      SteamProvider({
        nextAuthUrl: `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL!}/api/auth/callback`,
        onUserInfoRequest: (ctx: onUserInfoRequestContext) => {
          // execute something on token request
          // some profile data which will be returned back to you on the client
          // example get the player data and merge it with the user info, therefore you wont need to pass any secret to us

          const response = await fetch(
            `https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=${MY_API_KEY}&steamids=${ctx.tokens.steamId}`
          )

          const data = await response.json()
          return data.response.players[0]
        }
      }, request),
    ],
  };
};

// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import { authOptionsWithRequest } from "@/utils/auth";

const auth = async (req: any, res: any) => {
  return await NextAuth(req, res, authOptionsWithRequest(req));
};

export { auth as GET, auth as POST };

// app/account/page.tsx
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
import { authOptions } from '@/utils/auth';
import Dashboard from '@/components/account/dashboard';

export default async function AccountPage() {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);

  return (
    <Dashboard profile={session.profile} />
  );
};
```

## üóø Vision

We would like to make the support for Steam seamless as possible

- The package itself we will aim to optimize the bundle size, although since has `openid` npm package which uses node modules makes it difficult. We're using vite at the moment, with `vite-plugin-node-polyfills`.
- `Request` it is something that I'd like to deprecate near the future, another reason why it is optional and only necessary in one place `NextAuth()`. This is difficult at the moment, due of steam has legacy version of `openid`, else it would be easily integrable just like the other providers. You can see further at `next-auth -> core\lib\oauth\callback.js:103`, and a [Vercel/Next discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/42732) about why request is not accessible on the backend upon callbacks.
- With a hope that steam will upgrade their implementation like the other providers, this package could implement those changes to support steam newer implementation, which eventually we hope that NextJS will have it as part of their providers implementation.

## ‚è≥ Something went wrong

Let us know about the issue, you can open an issue on the [Github repository](https://github.com/NovaPlay-Gaming/next-auth-steam) | PR's are welcome and it is helpful not only for us, but for everyone else who uses the package & future engineers who require it.

We highly suggest you to make sure that the package is updated to latest version, as we may need to update the implementation as per times changes.
